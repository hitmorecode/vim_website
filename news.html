                Vim patch 9.1.1391 adds support for a vertical tabpanel.
                
                Vim patch v9.1.1391 brings support for a vertical tabpanel. This is similar to the tabline feature, but instead of using
                a single horizontally line to show all tabpages, Vim will use a vertical tabpanel. You can customize how this should look like when to display the tabpanel and what exactly should be shown using the various tabpanel options ('<a href="#">tabpanel</a>', '<a href="#">tabpanelopt</a>' and '<a href="#">showtabpanel</a>' option.) You can find some examples of how this changes, when looking at the pictures provided at the pull request <a href="#">17263</a>. This change has been contributed by Naruhiko Nishino, thanks for improving Vim!
                Happy Vimming!

              <p class="content">Vim patch 9.1.1243 brings some nice improvements to the vim diff highlighting. It is now possible to enable character- and word diffs. This brings it closer to other diff highlighting tools like meld and Visual Studio Code. You can enable this by setting the new suboption "inline" for the "diffopt" setting like this: :set diffopt+=inline:word or :set diffopt+=inline:char.

                Vim patch 9.1.1232 brings support for the Tuple data type to Vim Script. A tuple is immutable and uses less memory than a List data type, therefore being a bit more efficient than a list type and it is now available in Vim Script thanks to Yegappan Lakshmanan. A huge thanks for doing this work! Please see the extensive help for the documentation.

                On February 25th, we celebrate Free Software and the incredible communities that make it possible. And what better
                occasion to express our gratitude to the Vim, Neovim, BusyBox Vi, and all Vi-related projects - a dedicated group of
                developers, maintainers, and users who continue to redefine what a text editor can be!
              <br>
                Vi and its descendants have stood the test of time, evolving into powerful, efficient, and customizable tools that developers, sysadmins, and writers rely on every day. Whether it's the legendary Vim, the modern and extensible Neovim, or the lightweight BusyBox Vi, these projects embody the spirit of freedom, flexibility, and innovation in software. The work we do as a community - enhancing these editors, maintaining plugins, refining documentation, and welcoming new users - is something to be proud of! On this special day, let's take a moment to reflect on the impact of Free Software and the people who build it. The FSFE's "I Love Free Software" campaign reminds us why open-source contributions matter, and posts like this one show the passion behind our work. And of course, we can never say thank you enough to Bram Moolenaar and everyone who has shaped Vim and its ecosystem over the years. To all contributors, maintainers, and users of Vim, Neovim, BusyBox Vi, and every Vi-inspired editor: your work matters, and today, we celebrate you!

                Patch 9.1.327 brings support for the freedesktop XDG Base Directory Specification and has now been merged. A few more
                adjustments have been made withe following patches: v9.1.0337 and 9.1.345. That means, you can now place your
                configuration files under ~/.config/vim/ instead of ~/.vim so Vim will stop littering your home directory. Note: To make
                this change backwards compatible, Vim will only attempt to source from that location, if ~/.vim/vimrc and ~/.vimrc file
                do not exist. So it won't impact existing users, but users that want to start using the new location, will need to move
                their existing configuration to the new place. You can also read about it at :h xdg-base-dir. Thanks to all the contributors that help Vim continuing to grow!
