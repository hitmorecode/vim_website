            <p class="content">Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to make creating and changing any kind of
            text very efficient. It is included as "vi" with most UNIX systems and with Apple OS X.</p>

            <p class="content">Vim is rock stable and is continuously being developed to become even better. Among its
            features are:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>$ persistent, multi-level undo tree</li>
              <li>$ extensive plugin system</li>
              <li>$ support for hundreds of programming languages and file formats</li>

              trying to login) but hopefully they will be resolved very soon. The new vim.org domain name
              should then resolve to the new IP 31.172.117.18. This homepage here will stay in read-only
              mode and no longer maintained. Read the <span><a href="">announcement</a></span> at the vim_announce mailing list. (Christian Brabandt)</p>

              <h2>RIP Bram Moolenaar</h2>
              <p>2023-08-09</p>
            </section>
            <article>
              <p class="content">The Vim project is deeply shocked and saddened by the <span><a href="">sudden passing of Bram</a></span>. We certainly
              will miss him, his guidance and his humour. The Vim project wouldn't exist without his
              ongoing passion to lead and develop Vim and the community for more than 30 years.</p>

              <p>Our deepest condolences to all his family and may they have enough strengths to come through
              these saddened times. We lost a great guy way too early, who should have had the chance to
              enjoy and live for at least several more years!</p>

              <p>In addition he was well-known for collecting donations for the <span><a href="">ICCF foundation</a></span> and helping
              many children in Uganda. And despite the saddened news, during the last 7 days an incredible
              amount of EURO 60,000 was donated. That is so awesome. Thank you all contributors! An
              incredible amount of people have been giving respect and saying goodby and <span><a href="">here</a></span> and you'll
              find obituary articles and links <span><a href="">here</a></span>.</p>

              <p>It is in Brams interest to continue the Vim project even if development now will slow down,
              but hopefully the community is being able to step up and continue the work in the next
              years. (Christian Brabandt)</p>
